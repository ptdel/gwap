# gwap

"The gwap service" is the backend for a financial simulation game a friend and I worked on for a period of time.  The service makes a securities "universe" of 2700+ ticker symbols, with each ticker being a random walk on it's initial "valuation".  Clients listen to individual ticker symbols that emit over a websocket on an open-close market cycle.  Maybe one day we'll see it through to the end.
